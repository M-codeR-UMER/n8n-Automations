# Email Scraping Automation Project

## Overview

This project automates the process of **email scraping** using **n8n**, an open-source workflow automation tool. It allows you to extract email addresses from various data sources (web pages, text files, or APIs) automatically. This workflow is designed to streamline data collection, making it ideal for tasks such as **lead generation**, **contact list building**, and **gathering email data** from various online sources.

## Features

- **Automated Email Scraping**: Automatically scrape email addresses from various input sources like web pages, text, or APIs.
- **Third-Party Integration**: Seamlessly integrate with multiple platforms and data sources (e.g., Gmail, APIs, HTTP requests).
- **Customizable Workflow**: Easily configure the scraping logic to target specific patterns or domains for emails.
- **Efficient Data Collection**: Quickly process and store email data from multiple sources with minimal manual intervention.
- **Output Flexibility**: Export data to various formats and destinations, including Google Sheets, databases, or CSV files.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, ensure you have the following installed and configured:

1. **n8n**: Follow the official [n8n installation guide](https://n8n.io/docs/installation/) to set up n8n on your system.
2. **n8n Basic Knowledge**: Basic understanding of how n8n workflows work and the nodes involved.
3. **API Keys/Access**: For integrations (like Gmail or third-party services), you will need API keys or access tokens.

## Workflow Overview

The **Email Scraping Workflow** contains the following key stages:

- **Trigger Node**: Defines the starting point of the workflow, which could be time-based, event-driven, or manual.
- **Scraping Nodes**: Nodes responsible for extracting email addresses from provided data sources (like websites, text, or APIs).
- **Data Processing**: Cleans and validates the scraped emails (e.g., removing duplicates, checking for valid email formats).
- **Output Nodes**: Stores the final results in the desired location (Google Sheets, databases, CSV files, etc.).

## Usage

### Run the Workflow

- **Manually Triggered**: You can start the workflow at any time through the n8n UI or configure a trigger for automatic execution.
- **Monitor the Process**: You can monitor the workflow logs within the n8n dashboard to track the progress and troubleshoot any issues.

## Sample Output

Once the workflow runs, you’ll have the following options for viewing and using the data:

- **Google Sheets**: The scraped emails can be exported directly to Google Sheets.
- **CSV Files**: The emails can also be saved as CSV files for easy download and usage.
- **Databases**: For more complex workflows, emails can be pushed into databases for further processing.
